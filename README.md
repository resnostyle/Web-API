# LaranZEDb-FrontEnd
Laravel replacement for the front-end (API and Website) of nZEDb

### Why?
Because why not. The nZEDb codebase is ancient and epic. The best way forward in my opinion is to wipe and start over. 
Beginning with a complete re-write of the front-end and separation of concerns. Each piece should be modeled and focused 
on it's job. Mixing of mulitple uses in one codebase adds needless complexity and makes the application difficult to scale
and configure for distributed environments.

### So you are duplicating all of nZEDb in Laravel?
Eventually, yes, but that is a long-term goal. At first we will be replacing the front-end with a new Laravel-based front-end.

### I can install now?
Nah. It's little more than the basic boilerplate laravel install at this point. We'll update this readme when we get closer 
to an actual Release Candidate. 

### Can I help?
Absolutely, feel free to pick a feature and submit a PR or post an issue to ask questions on what you should work on. Also 
you can pop into our IRC channel to discuss: #LaranZEDb on irc.synirc.net.
